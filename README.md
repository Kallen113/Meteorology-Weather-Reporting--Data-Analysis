# Meteorology-Weather-Reporting--Data-Analysis
Data Analysis Comparing the Accuracy of Weather Reports by TV Networks &amp; Meteorology Sources



In this project, we will collect data on weather forecasts of U.S. TV Networks' weather forecasts. Using Python, we will analyze the 1) accuracy of these weather forecasts by comparing trhe forecasts with actual historical temperature data. 2) Secondly, we will compare the accuracy of each TV Networks with each other and with public sector weather reports and other online weather reporting organizations.

See To-Dos section below for details on the next steps for this project (NB: this is still in the very early stages of this project; it's mostly a project proposal for the moment).

## To-Dos:

1) Collect various U.S. weather reports data by TV Network.Collect weather reports at the city level, and our main metric of interest will be forecasted highs & lows for the day. Precipitation data would be interesting to collect as well, but might over-complicate the analysis for now.

2) Collect historical temperature data. This will serve as the *actual* temperature data that we will compare with the weather reports' forecasts.

3) In relation to points 1 & 2, we will possibly need to use the Wayback Machine. 

But the challenge will be how to programmatically access the Wayback Machine for each desired day of data? Perhaps we can develop a webcrawler via Python that will iterate through various dates for the data we want to collect?
